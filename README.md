## How to contribute

Want to help make QuickSnip even better? You can contribute by:

- **Improving the Code**: Fix bugs, suggest new features, or optimize the project.
- **Adding New Snippets**: Share your favorite snippets to grow the database.

Be sure to check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed guidelines.

### Improving the code

- **Reporting bugs**

    - If you spot a bug in the codebase or issues with the documentation, please open up a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dostonnabotov/quicksnip/issues) detailing the problem before creating a PR. 
    - Once confirmed with maintainers, you can then create a PR.

- **Proposing new features**

    - If you are interested in proposing new features, please open up a new [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/dostonnabotov/quicksnip/discussions) with details for the proposed feature.
    - Please do **not** create a PR for a new feature without first discussing it with the maintainers. If you create a PR for a new feature without discussing it first, then your PR will be closed.

### Adding a Snippet

The snippets database is located in the `/snippets` folder.

1. Find the relevant language folder.

2. Locate the appropriate category folder for your snippet.

3. Create a markdown file and add your snippet using the following format:

````md
---
title: Name of the snippet
description: A short explanation of what the snippet does
tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
author: your-github-username
---

```lang
// Your code here
```
````

Here's an example for JavaScript:

````md
---
title: Format Date
description: Formats a date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.
author: dostonnabotov
tags: javascript,date,format
---

```js
const formatDate = (date) => date.toISOString().split('T')[0];

// Usage:
console.log(formatDate(new Date())); // Output: '2024-12-10'
```
````

Expected file structure:

```md
/snippets
  |- language
    |- category-name
      |- your-snippet-here.md
```

> Please do **NOT** add or edit anything in `/public` folder. It will be used for consolidating snippets.

To test that your snippets are formatted correctly use the `snippets:check` script:
```
$ npm run snippets:check
```
It will return nothing if they are well formatted, otherwise it will tell you what the error is.

---
To preview the snippets, you need to consolidate them, use the `snippets:consolidate` script:
```
$ npm run snippets:consolidate
```
It will update the snippets in the `/public` folder, making them available to the frontend.

For more details about adding new categories or programming languages, check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
